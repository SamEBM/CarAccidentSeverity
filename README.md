Having a vehicle is practically a basic necessity for people anywhere in the world. However, due to the large number of people in big cities, imprudence and different climatic or circumstantial factors, road accidents are part of the day to day in the streets. For this reason, it is important for any driver to be able to avoid an accident, especially those of high severity, which can result in a catastrophic end.

Being able to predict the severity or probability of an accident is highly useful for the well-being of any driver or pedestrian. This would undoubtedly help all drivers to have a greater perspective on possible accidents and thus make the best decision about whether to drive, not drive or do it in a safer way.

This is an example of the application of **Data Science** and **Supervised Machine Learning** to predict the severity of a car accident based on multiple factors using a car collisions dataset from Seattle.
